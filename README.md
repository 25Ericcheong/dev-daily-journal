# Track my Stash
## Project Description
Web app project to track my ~~stash~~ finance haha.

I plan on utilizing the MERN stack and the following frameworks:
* Tailwind CSS <br>
* Express.js

Still need to connect to Mongo DB with Mongoose and ensure that a connection is made from the client (frontend) to the server (backend).

## In Progress / Reading
* Currently following the following: https://blog.logrocket.com/mern-stack-tutorial/ for setup 
* https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html
* Mongoose getting started: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html
* Mongoose schema: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html
* Mongoose models: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html

## Documentation
Acts as my log book essential - not really a documentation of the code (could be - depends on how I go in terms of development). Everything can be found via this [link](../../wiki)

# Dev daily journal
## Project Description
Web app project to log what I've learnt and my daily achievements! I haven't really been able to log these achievements in a more structured manner and I believe by having a personalized or internal tool - I would be able to do this more!

## Goals
- Naturally, this web app or tool should enable a user to create a log, categorize the log as an achievement or a simple note and save these newly created logs in a database. User should be able to delete or modify these logs as well.
- Use and familiarize Node.js as the backend and ensure React can be rendered in the server (with TypeScript as well if possible). In addition to this, I also would like to learn PostgreSQL too (or Mongo in this case).

## Timeline
- [ ] Project configuration and setup [19/03/2023]
- [ ] To be able to create, modify, acquire and delete existing logs [02/04/2023]
- [ ] A starting page that asks user to create an account or allow them to look at my "achievements" [09/04/2023]
- [ ] Deployment and bug fixes if any pops up [23/04/2023]

## Bonus
- [ ] Setting up tools for testing that tests code before pushing things into production. Possibly have an isolated testing environment first [???]
- [ ] Continuous integration to ensure tests are executed and provide feedback if something goes wrong [???]

## Structure
- The Odin project will be the guide that I will follow as I slowly build this project and with progress - I will document each step of it for reference and at the same time; data to be inserted into this project haha.

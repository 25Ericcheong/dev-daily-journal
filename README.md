# Track my Stash
## Project Description
Web app project to track my ~~stash~~ finance haha.

I plan on utilizing the MERN stack and the following frameworks:
* Tailwind CSS <br>
* Express.js

Still need to connect to Mongo DB with Mongoose and ensure that a connection is made from the client (frontend) to the server (backend).

## In Progress / Reading
* Currently going through the Odin Project - https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs

## Documentation
Acts as my log book essential - not really a documentation of the code (could be - depends on how I go in terms of development). Everything can be found via this [link](../../wiki)

<h1>Track my Stash</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
Web app project to track my ~~stash~~ finance haha.

I plan on utilizing the MERN stack and the following frameworks:

Tailwind CSS <br>
Express.js

Still need to connect to Mongo DB with Mongoose.

Can follow this guideline https://blog.logrocket.com/mern-stack-tutorial/ and https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-set-up-node-typescript-express/

<h5>Setting up builds</h5>
- Had a bit of a hiccup when trying to setup the backend. Realized that the scripts command be executed were not correctly set. This will be used as a reference to explain why specific commands were used based on attached source (a bit more researching done for my benefit). <br/>
- `npx tsc` compiles the TypeScipript back to vanilla JavaScript. To ensure we do not need to run this command over again, we can ensure this is watched and include the following command `npx tsc --watch` which compiles our project whenever any changes are made/saved.

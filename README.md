Web app project to track my stash.

I plan on utilizing the MERN stack with Tailwind CSS as the chosen CSS framework while Express.js being the backend.

Still need to ensure backend has typescript, connected to Mongo DB with Mongoose and ensure we have Tailwind CSS library installed on frontend as well.

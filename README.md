Web app project to track my stash.

I plan on utilizing the MERN stack with Tailwind CSS as the chosen CSS framework while Express.js being the backend.

Still need to connect to Mongo DB with Mongoose. Can follow this guideline https://blog.logrocket.com/mern-stack-tutorial/ and https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-set-up-node-typescript-express/
